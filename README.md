# Lemi

# What is Lemi?
Lemi is your friend, your right hand, your saviour. Lemi is designed to be your virtual assistant, on your watch, so that whenever you need an action to take, it'll help you to the fullest.

# But it has been done, isn't it?
We know there's Google Assistant and Siri. But Lemi isn't just confined to restricted operations. Lemi is flexible with accepting new commands according to your liking.

# Why you started such a project?
Me and my friend were thinking of such an assistant on a smart watch, to ease usage of a smart phone and flee from Siri and Google Assistant's restrictive functions

# Any problems? 
Feel free to inform, will fix it ASAP.
